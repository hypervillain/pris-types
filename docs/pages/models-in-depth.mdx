# Models In Depth (wip)

Writing Prismic Models along with your components, without leaving your favourite IDE is the core of `pris-types`.

Of course, this requires a syntax to learn, that's hopefully not too far from what experienced Prismic users are used to.

## Slice Model

Prismic slice models are JSON files that describe both the shape of the data you receive from Prismic API and how your content editors
enter content on the platform. They're composed of different parts that I'll try to explain briefly.

#### Meta

First come meta fields that describe your slice and help you understand what you get from the API (that's the role of `id`, which is a `unique-string` that matches your `UniqueString` component).

```javascript
{
  id: 'a-unique-id',
  title: 'The Title that my editors will see',
  description: 'The description of the said slice',
  imageUrl: 'A URL of the preview of your component'
}
```

#### Variations

Variations are an array of objects that store the different fields of your slice. Each variation includes a small difference to other variations (eg. a second button or a background image).
Each of them is composed of a non-repeatable `primary` zone, and a repeatable zone called `items`.

```javascript
{
  variations: [{
    id: 'default-variation',
    primary: {
      oneBoolean: {
        type: 'Boolean',
        config: {
          placeholder_true: 'true',
          placeholder_false: 'really false'
          default_value: true,
        }
      }
    },
    items: {
      manyImages: {
        type: 'Image',
        config: {
          label: 'My Label',
          constraint: {
            width: "500",
            height: "800"
          },
        },
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

## Using pris-types

`pris-types` offers a different syntax that will get converted to a valid JSON model.
If we take what's been written in the previous code snippet, this would give:

```javascript
import { PrisTypes } from 'pris-types'

export const Model = PrisTypes.shape({
  __meta: { title: 'My title', description: 'My description'},
  defaultVariation: PrisTypes.variation({
    primary: {
      oneBoolean: PrisTypes.Boolean
    },
    items: {
      manyImages: PrisTypes.Image({
        constraint: "500x800"
      })
    }
  })
})

````

ðŸ‘† This portion of code offers us some insight.

First, a JS model is an export named `Model` that calls a `PrisTypes.shape` method.

**This method takes a single argument but at least 2 properties:**

#### __meta (required)

This object should contain the title and description of your slice. Note that the `id` is automatically generated,
based on the name of your slice and that the `imageUrl` is appended by the slice builder.

#### anyCamelCaseKey (required)

Each slice contains at least one variation. `PrisTypes.shape` looks for all first-level keys you defined
and will transform them to the array of variations the JSON model expects.

So, if you wanted to add a second variation, you would simply:

```javascript
export const Model = PrisTypes.shape({
  __meta: { title: 'My title', description: 'My description'},
  defaultVariation: PrisTypes.variation({
    primary: {
      oneBoolean: PrisTypes.Boolean
    },
  }),
  secondVariation: PrisTypes.variation({
    primary: {
      description: PrisTypes.RichText
    },
  })
})

````

ðŸ‘† Something to be noted here is that although PrisTypes helpers are functions, they return
the correct configuration without actually being called. This is one of the roles of `PrisTypes.variation`!

## Common fields

Because variations are a set of related data shapes, they are usually close to each other.
To leverage this, `pris-types` offers a simple syntax to **spread fields to all variations**:

```javascript
export const Model = PrisTypes.shape({
  __meta: { title: 'My Slice', description: 'A simple slice' },
  __common: {
    primary: {
      title: PrisTypes.Title,
    },
    items: {
      color: PrisTypes.Color
    }
  },
  defaultVariation: PrisTypes.variation({
    primary: {
      description: PrisTypes.RichText({ multi: true }),
    },
  }),
  anotherVariation: PrisTypes.variation()
})

````

As you could probably guess here, fields `title` and `color` will be spread to their respective zones
in both variations. The `defaultVariation` primary zone now contains 2 fields: `title` and `description`.
The `anotherVariation` primary zone will also contain a title.
