# Frequently Asked Questions

To be honest, I haven't been asked a lot of questions regarding `pris-types`.
So, this page is mostly made of questions I asked myself during development.

### Can I delete my model on build? How?

You can delete the Model key and imports on build.

### Can I destructure PrisTypes?

Before running your function, the module requires `PrisTypes` and destructures all its fields:

```javascript
const { PrisTypes, PrisMocks } = require('pris-types')
const { Boolean, RichText, /* ... */ }  = PrisTypes
````

This means that instead of calling `PrisTypes.foo` you can import field types separately too:

```javascript
import { PrisTypes: { RichText, Boolean } } from 'pris-types'

const title = RichText({ options: ['heading1'] })
````

### Using custom functions in Model returns `undefined`. Why?

My guess is you did something like this, thinking it woud work:

```javascript
import { PrisTypes } from 'pris-types'
const randomString = () => `...`

const bool = PrisTypes.Boolean({ placeholder: randomString() })
````

Unfortunately, `pris-types` evaluates your code in a certain context
and at the moment, this context cannot be extended.
